    <h1 class="main">About Maintenance Loan</h1>
    <h3>Maintenance loans are designed to support you with living costs such as food, accommodation and travel.

        For many students, this is the main source of income during their time at university, which is why it's important to have a clear idea of how much you can expect to receive, and budget for all of your financial commitments such as accommodation, bills and subscriptions, and travel expenses.
