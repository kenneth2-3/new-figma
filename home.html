    <h3>What is a Home Loan?
        A home loan is an amount an individual borrows from a financial institution such as a housing finance company to buy a new or a resale home, construct a home or renovate or extend an existing one. The money is borrowed at a specific interest rate and repaid within a particular duration in smaller instalments known as EMIs (Equated monthly instalments).

        Eligibility Criteria for Home Loans
        Current age & loan repayment tenure
        Your age plays a vital role in determining home loan eligibility. The younger you are, the better your chances of getting home loan approval. Also, when you are young, you can get a loan for a longer duration.
        <br>
        <br>
        Financial profile of the customer
        Income stability and quantum of income significantly impact the amount you can borrow. Whether you are a salaried employee or self-employed, you must have a steady income.
        <br>
        <br>
        Credit score
        A high credit score and clean repayment records will enhance your chances of getting a faster loan approval.
        <br>
        <br>
        Other financial obligations
        Lenders evaluate the existing liabilities such as personal loans, credit card bills, car loans, etc., to ensure that you have the financial capacity to repay the home loan. If you have no liabilities, you may get your loan approved without any hassles.</h3>
